# Correlation of train stations and cars
This repo was created by participating in the MADE course of the Open Source Professorship at FAU.
The code and more information about my project can be found in the project folder.
Final report can be found [here](https://github.com/flo0852/made/blob/main/project/Report.ipynb).

## Main Question
How does the number of train stations per qm in a county affect the number of cars per 1000 residents in this county?

## Description
In days of global climate change, it gets more and more important to go climate friendly. One possibility to do this is by using the train instead of the car. Or in the best case not even having a car.
So the aim of this project is to find out, whether the number of train stations per qkm has an influence on the number of cars per 1000 residents in this county.
So if the answer to this question would be true, it could be a possibility to build more train stations in order to decrease the number of cars and so become more climate friendly.
